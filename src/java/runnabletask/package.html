    <p>Provides a framework for asynchronously executing a serializable {@link Runnable} via
    Google App Engine's <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/taskqueue/overview.html">Task Queue</a>.</p>

    <p>Google App Engine's model for task queues is centered around web hooks.
    The developer of the task implements it as a servlet and binds it to a
    (relative) URL in the application. The developer then provides this URL and
    an optional set of parameters when firing off an asynchronous task. This
    model is a sound implementation-agnostic API, but is a bit inconvenient to
    use from the JVM, as it requires the user to create a servlet, deal with
    HTTP requests, responses, and parameters, and edit web.xml for each asynchronous
    task. This is particularly frustrating since Java provides a sound model for
    asynchronous execution in the {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} interface.</p>

    <p>This package builds on top of the Google App Engine web-oriented task queues
    to create a fluent Java- and Scala-oriented means to asynchronously perform work.</p>

    Example Scala usage:
<pre style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 4px; background-color: #eee">
import runnabletask.SerializableRunnableFactory._
import runnabletask.TaskQueueExecutor
import runnabletask.TaskQueueExecutor._

val executor = new TaskQueueExecutor
executor execute <i>runnable</i> {
  if (<i>retryCount</i> == 0) {
    // work work work
  } else {
    // the task has failed at least once; maybe do something different?
  }
}
</pre>

    Example Java usage:
<pre style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 4px; background-color: #eee">
import runnabletask.SerializableRunnable;
import runnabletask.TaskQueueExecutor;
import static runnabletask.TaskQueueExecutor.*;

Executor executor = new TaskQueueExecutor();
executor.execute(new SerializableRunnable() {
    public void run() {
        if (<i>retryCount()</i> == 0) {
            // work work work
        } else {
            // the task has failed at least once; maybe do something different?
        }
    }
});
</pre>

    <p>To use the TaskQueueExecutor, you must bind the <code>RunnableTaskServlet</code>
    to an endpoint in your <code>web.xml</code> configuration file. The default
    constructor for <code>TaskQueueExecutor</code> assumes that the servlet is
    bound to <code>/tasks/RunnableTaskServlet</code>, but you can put it anywhere
    you'd like and provide a (relative) URL to the constructor.</p>

    <p>Since the <code>RunnableTaskServlet</code> allows arbitrary code to be
    executed, you should also provide a security constraint to limit access to the
    URL to admins only. As a further security precaution, the servlet checks all
    requests to ensure they're from the task queue.</p>

    <p>Put the following snippet into your <code>web.xml</code> configuration
    file for default behavior:</p>

<pre style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 4px; background-color: #eee">
&lt;servlet&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;runnabletask&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;servlet-class&gt;runnabletask.RunnableTaskServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;
&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;runnabletask&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/tasks/RunnableTaskServlet&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;

&lt;security-constraint&gt;
    &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;
        &lt;url-pattern&gt;/tasks/RunnableTaskServlet&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;
    &lt;auth-constraint&gt;
        &lt;role-name&gt;admin&lt;/role-name&gt;
    &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;
&lt;/security-constraint&gt;
</pre>

    <p>Since this sits on top of the Google App Engine queues, all of the task queue
    restrictions apply. Notable restrictions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The task is given a 30-second window to execute within, after which time it
        will be terminated by Google App Engine. Of course, a task can start another
        task, so you can subdivide your problem as needed.</li>

        <li>Google App Engine restricts the size of the task object to 10 kilobytes.
        This framework serializes your Runnable and forwards it along to the task queue.
        It first attempts to add the serialized Runnable as a parameter to a task. If 
		this fails, it falls back to storing the Runnable in the datastore and then 
		sending the stored object's key along as an HTTP parameter. So, closures of 
		unlimited size are supported, but not necessarily recommended.</li>

        <li>When defining an anonymous inner class (Java) or closure (Scala), the
        variables that are closed upon will be serialized along with the Runnable.
        Of course, this impacts the size (see previous limitation). But it's important
        to recognize that since the task will run in a separate JVM, the closure will
        not share VM state with the invoking context after the serialization occurs.</li>
    </ul>
